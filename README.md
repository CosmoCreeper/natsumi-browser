## Meet Natsumi! ðŸ¦‹
Natsumi Browser (or Natsumi, for short) is a skin made for Firefox and its forks that adds lots of
polish to the design by incorporating animations, blurs and more. It's pretty much the skin I
personally use, but made public because people wanted the CSS.

Natsumi is NOT a standalone browser. I don't even intend on making one.

> [!NOTE]
> Please remember that Natsumi in the end is **my personal browser skin**. If you don't like a design
> choice I've made, chances are I'll keep it if I still like it. So please be respectful and refrain
> from attacking people when you make suggestions. Thanks!

## Features
Still working on this

## Installation
You will need to install Natsumi by copying its files to your profile's chrome folder.

### Natsumi Browser
#### If you already have a userChrome.css/userContent.css file
1. Copy natsumi-config.css and natsumi folder to your chrome folder.
2. Add `@import "natsumi/natsumi.css";` to the beginning of your userChrome.css file. 
3. Add `@import "natsumi/natsumi-pages.css";` to the beginning of your userContent.css file.
4. Restart your browser and enjoy!

#### If you don't have a userChrome.css/userContent.css file
1. Create a new chrome folder in your profile folder, if you haven't already.
   ([guide](https://docs.zen-browser.app/guides/live-editing))
2. Copy userChrome.css and userContent.css to the chrome folder.
3. Copy natsumi-config.css and natsumi folder to the chrome folder.
4. Restart your browser and enjoy!

## Browser configs (in about:config)
These are the configs you can use to tweak Natsumi Browser. If you want to tweak the animation duration
and delay, change the variables in the config.css file.

Working on this one too

## FAQs
### "Can I use other userchromes with Natsumi?"
Sure! Just paste it right below the Natsumi Browser loader (userChrome.css) and you can use your own
userchrome alongside Natsumi Browser.

### "Can I disable individual features?"
You can disable some features using the configuration options.

If that doesn't help, you can remove certain modules (CSS files) from the natsumi.css file. However,
you will need to keep certain files (preload, postload, natsumi-config) for Natsumi to work properly.

> [!CAUTION]
> By modifying any part of Natsumi, you are responsible for any issues that may arise. If things do
> break, I will most likely not offer support for it.
> 
> If you installed Natsumi as part of another skin, your installation may be considered modified.
> Please check with the skin's developer for assistance in this case.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with Zen Browser?"
As of Natsumi v4, Natsumi has dropped all support for Zen Browser. I have no plans to continue
support whatsoever due to the browser's main developer's continued attacks on personalization.

### "When does Natsumi update?"
There is no fixed schedule for updates, it all happens randomly.

### "Is Natsumi compatible with non-Firefox-based browsers (Chrome, Arc, etc.)?"
No. Natsumi is made on top of Firefox, so it only supports Firefox and (most of) its forks.

If you try to apply Natsumi on Chrome/Chromium-based browsers like Arc, you can't apply
userchrome CSS files, making Natsumi completely incompatible with those browsers.

### "I don't like the design, please change it!"
If I like the design, nah. My personal skin, my rules.

### "Why is userChrome.css so empty?"
Natsumi Browser uses a system where the userChrome.css file acts as a loader that loads the skin,
instead of being the file that contains all rules. This way, it's easier for users to quickly enable
and disable custom CSS.

## Troubleshooting
### "URLbar blur won't work!"
Make sure both `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` and `layout.css.backdrop-filter.force-enabled` are
set to true. Also make sure that you're using WebRender and hardware rendering.

### "I don't see any of the Natsumi options in about:config!"
These are custom options which you need to create. Type in the exact name, then press the plus button on
the right to create the config.

### "Something's bugged!"
There may be userchromes that you're using alongside Natsumi Browser that breaks things. Please disable
these then try again.

If the issue still persists, open an issue or report the bug to the developer through Discord.

### "Can I use your code for my browser?"
If your browser is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3 or later (or AGPLv3 or later), then yes.
Otherwise, please contact me so I can grant you permission.
